=head1 NAME

Stream::Buffered - Temporary buffer to save bytes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Stream::Buffered;

    my $buf = Stream::Buffered.new($length);

    $buf.print("foo");
    my Int $size = $buf.size;
    my IO::Handle $io = $buf.rewind;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stream::Buffered is a buffer class to store arbitrary length of byte
strings and then get a seekable IO::Handle once everything is buffered.
It uses Blob and temporary file to save the buffer depending on the length of the size.

This library is a perl6 port of L<perl5's Stream::Buffered|https://metacpan.org/pod/Stream::Buffered>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new(Int $length, Int $maxMemoryBufferSize = 1024 * 1024) returns Stream::Buffered>

Creates instance.

When you specify negative value as C<$maxMemoryBufferSize>, Stream::Buffered always uses Blob as buffer.
Or when you specify 0 as C<$maxMemoryBufferSize>, Stream::Buffered always uses temporary file as buffer.

If you pass 0 to the first argument, Stream::Buffered decides what kind of buffer type (Blob or temp file)
to use automatically.

=head2 C<print(Stream::Buffered:D: *@text) returns Bool>

Append text to buffer.

=head2 C<size(Stream::Buffered:D:) returns Int>

Return the size of buffer.

=head2 C<rewind(Stream::Buffered:D:) returns IO::Handle>

Seek to the head of buffer and return buffer.
